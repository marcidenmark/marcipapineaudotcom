          Listed above is a sampling of some of the newspapers and magazines I have worked for. 
          Target groups may vary, but publications share a common goal of conveying information that is 
          specifically tailored to their audience’s interests.

          The Challenge
        </div>
        <p class="p-margin-top-none">
          In order for a publication to be profitable, it needs to be able to get users/readers to want to read, and
          become involved with the content
          for a period of time. It is best if they want to read more than one issue. It has to look like itself but different in every issue. Things
          such as colors, fonts and layout styles
          need to be in the same style in order to create unity.
          It needs to be visually interesting for its target group. It also has a very firm deadline. Printers do not
          wait.

          These magazines focused on fashion, beauty, entertainment, and knitting. In most of them, the photography was shot specifically
          for the publication using models and including hair and makeup artists at the photoshoot. There were celebrities photos that were bought from photo agencies.
          There was a lot of work that went into the typography adding more depth to the story.

                  Penge is a Danish magazine about personal finance. I brought the user through the magazine from the cover to the 
                  final investment pages. We often needed to use stock photography, and a lot of time went into finding unique images.
                  I completed a redesign when I arrived at the publication boosting its readership and circulation.

<!-- Process -->
        <div class="headlines-in-banner">The Process of creating a magazine or newspaper</div>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 1</span> Meet with editors and writers, learn about the stories coming up, and start
          the process of what visual will be used. Things considered: Photography (stock photo, or a hired photographer)?
          Illustration (self-made or needs to hire an illustrator)? Type-only design? <br>
          In financial stories, are the numbers ready to be made into a graphic? Is there more data that needs to be acquired to 
          help tell the story?
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 2</span> After initial meetings, start looking for what to use to visualize the story.
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 3</span> Commission art for photographers, illustrators.
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 4</span> Start to layout the story (in InDesign).
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 5</span> Show layout to managing editor.

        <p> <span class="bold">Step 6</span> Make changes as needed.

        <p> <span class="bold">Step 7</span> Sign off on the design.
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 8</span> Send to editors to edit the story to fit.
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 9</span> Make color tests of the photographs.
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 10</span> Cover design. Decide on image. Get headlines. Place them in the file.
          See if they fit in a visually pleasing way. Make edits. This is an iterative process.
        </p>
        <p> <span class="bold">Step 11</span> Send to the printer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the above process style sheets and templates are created in InDesign to keep a cohesive look,
          and make it easier to make layouts.
        </p>

        <p>Designs are based on the users. Colors and typography vary greatly in accordance with specific target audiences.
