            I started with a wireframe where the other members of the group have had the possibility for feedback. Based on this feedback I updated  the wireframe.
            Then in Figma the color palette, typography system, and components (forms, buttons, button states, and cards) were built.
            After creating the components for easy reuse, I started to layout some forms with real information. It is still a work in progress.

              After recieving the Invision files, I drew wireframes to block out how I would code the pages.
              This was a great way to keep track of how many styles should be created.

            <p>
              After the wireframes were handed over I began to build the pages in Wordpress–

          <p>Marci was in the core team creating a workable product for the second iteration of ThePlatypus.
          This iteration was useful in getting our second round of investment.
          Working closely with the 3 founders, a backender and our other UX designer, in the first 3 months, she had our on boarding process fully
          functioning on mobile and desktop devises (through design and code).
          Marci helped to improve the usability of the product— especially within how we visualise our data— which is one of the most important aspects of
          ThePlatypus. She gave input on how to make the product easier to use, helped make sure things were completed on time. and asked insightful questions
          during product meetings.

              All of this was done on an incredibly tight schedule as we (successfully) pushed for investment.

              She has created a design library for us which makes it easy for new teammates to adopt. I’m impressed with her work and grateful to know that our

          <div class="headlines-in-banner">About</div>
        <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
          I have a design degree from School of Visual Arts (SVA) in NYC, and have completed Le Wagon's Full Stack 9 week bootcamp. </p>

        <p>
          These two educations give me the unique characteristic of being both a designer and coder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make websites and SaaS products – combining code and design for quick beautiful solutions. </p>
        <p>  I often design with code – directly in the browser to it can save time and money.
          When designing in code, we become aware of dificulties that may arise from a design, and can tackle
          them early in the process.
        </p>
        <p>At the same time, in order to test the product I can work in Figma.</p>
        <p><strong>Note to Companies Looking for help</strong> <br>
        I can create quick iterations from wireframes and sketches to beautifully coded websites and interfaces.</p>
        <p><strong>Note to developers creating products </strong> <br>
          With the wireframes created, I can code them into pixel perfect interfaces. I have done full stack work with Rails, Django and React, and understand how to communicate with the backend people.
        <p> <strong>Special note to CEO’s, COOs… </strong> <br>
          I specialise in startups needing quick deployment. As a startup, you want the most for your money. Hire me and I will do your frontend design / UI and code at the same time.
