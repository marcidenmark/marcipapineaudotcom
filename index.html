          <p>Marci was in the core team creating a workable product for the second iteration of ThePlatypus.
          This iteration was useful in getting our second round of investment.
          Working closely with the 3 founders, a backender and our other UX designer, in the first 3 months, she had our on boarding process fully
          functioning on mobile and desktop devises (through design and code).
          Marci helped to improve the usability of the product— especially within how we visualise our data— which is one of the most important aspects of
          ThePlatypus. She gave input on how to make the product easier to use, helped make sure things were completed on time. and asked insightful questions
          during product meetings.

            <p>Marci was instrumental in our product development and helped us achieve very demanding goals within a short period of time.
              All of this was done on an incredibly tight schedule as we (successfully) pushed for investment,
              Marci helped us reach the next level - from a functional prototype - and was a joy to work with. <br>

              I love how independent she works. I can show her our concept, provide her with the content and she turns it into beautiful UI and
              flawless code. She is a hard worker and has high standards for her work.
              She has created a design library for us which makes it easy for new teammates to adopt. I’m impressed with her work and grateful to know that our
              website will remain a visual cohesive expression in the future.

              Her strong background in design and love for code makes her a valuable asset to my team. <br>

              and offer concrete, visual suggestions for key features. Having Marci on the project with us - a journalist and a developer -
              was an invaluable help.

        <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
          I have a design degree from School of Visual Arts (SVA) in NYC, and have completed Le Wagon's Full Stack 9 week bootcamp. "Through immersive coding bootcamps, Le Wagon
          teaches you the skills and entrepreneurial mindset you need to thrive - now and in the future." </p>

        <p>
          These two educations give me the unique characteristic of being both a designer and coder.
        </p>
<p>
          I now live and work from Copenhagen. I make websites and SaaS products combining code and design for quick beautiful solutions. </p>
        <p>  My specialty is desiging with code – directly in the browser. I do this because it saves a lot of time and money. When designing in code, I become aware of
          dificulties that may arise from a design, and can tackle it at an early enough place, that things can be changed quicker then if recieving a complicated
          design from a designer, that might not be so easy to code.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note to Companies Looking for help</strong> <br>
        I can create quick iterations from wireframes and sketches to beautifully coded websites and interfaces.</p>
        <p><strong>Note to developers creating products </strong> <br>
          With the wireframes created, I can code them into pixel perfect interfaces. I have done full stack work with Rails, Django and React, and understand how to communicate with the backend people.
        <p> <strong>Special note to CEO’s, COOs… </strong> <br>
          I specialise in startups needing quick deployment. As a startup, you want the most for your money. Hire me and I will do your frontend design / UI and code at the same time. This saves a lot of time and money.
