                  Visuals vary greatly between magazine types— for a teen magazine a teenage girl wants to see someone
                  like herself and maybe some cute boys.
                  An engineer will read something more complex and doesn't mind spending some time to understand a story.
                  How do you explain the complex transfer of energy between countries visually?
                  A family looking for advice on buying a new car might want to see something about cars that isn't what
                  they would see in a car dealership.

        <p>Marci was in the core team creating a workable product for the second iteration of Platypus.
          This iteration was useful in getting our second round of investment.
          Working closely with the 3 founders, a backender and our other UX designer, in the first 3 months, she had our
          on boarding process fully
          functioning on mobile and desktop devices (through design and code).
          Marci helped to improve the usability of the product— especially within how we visualise our data— which is
          one of the most important aspects of
          Platypus. She gave input on how to make the product easier to use, helped make sure things were completed
          on time, and asked insightful questions
          during product meetings.

            She has created a design library for us which makes it easy for new teammates to adopt. I’m impressed with
            her work and grateful to know that our
            website will remain a visual cohesive expression in the future.

            I love how independent she works. I can show her our concept, provide her with the content and she turns it
            into beautiful UI and
            flawless code. She is a hard worker and has high standards for her work.
            She has created a design library for us which makes it easy for new teammates to adopt. I’m impressed with
            her work and grateful to know that our
            website will remain a visual cohesive expression in the future.
            Her strong background in design and love for code makes her a valuable asset to my team. <br>

          <p>
            I have had the privilege to work with Marci at the Danish newspaper, Ingeniøren ("The Engineer") 
            and website, ing.dk.
            Marci was employed as Design Director, and certainly has very strong skills.
            She very quickly understood our readers and layout concept. During her stay at Ingeniøren 
            she also developed very interesting new ways of illustrating articles.
            Marci has been a highly skilled team leader of the visual department at Ingeniøren.

            She is a good listener who always involves the colleagues, but she also knows when to end a discussion and make the right decision.
            
            
            As a person she has been highly appreciated by all colleagues with her positive and smiling attitude.

          <p> Marci has sent Børsen on a most needed journey to get infographics in the newspaper that the readers can
            actually read and understand.
            With her help Børsen has come a long way in a very short period, and I can only highly recommend Marci for
            any publication that wants rapid
            improvement. And by the way, she is also fun to work with. <br>

        <p class="medium" style="margin-top: 5px;">
          I have a design degree from School of Visual Arts in New York City, and have completed Le Wagon's Full Stack 9
          week bootcamp. </p>
        <p class="medium">
          These two educations give me the unique characteristic of being both a designer and coder.
        </p>
        <p class="medium">
          I make websites and SaaS products&#8211; combining code and design for quick, beautiful solutions. 
        </p>
        <p class="medium"> I often design with code&#8211; directly in the browser saving time and money.
          When designing in code, we become aware of difficulties that may arise from a design, and can tackle
          them early in the process.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="medium">At the same time, in order to test the product I can work in Figma.</p> -->
        <p><strong>Note to Companies Looking for help</strong> <br>
          I can create quick iterations from wireframes and sketches to beautifully coded websites and interfaces.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Note to developers creating products </strong> <br>
          With the wireframes created, I can code the design into pixel perfect interfaces. I have done full stack work with
          Rails, Django and React, and understand how to communicate with the backend people.
          <p> <strong>Special note to CEO’s, COO's… </strong> <br>
            I specialize in startups needing quick deployment. As a startup, you want the most for your money. Hire me
            and I will do your frontend design, UI and code simultaneously.
