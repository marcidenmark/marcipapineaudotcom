              Business Case
            </div>
            <p class="p-margin-top-none">
              Platypus is a Copenhagen based startup working within HR. Its focus is to help companies make good hires, and retain talent.
            </p>

            <div class="headlines-in-banner">
              The Challenge
            </div>
              <p class="p-margin-top-none">
                Platypus was in an extremely early stage of development. They had a low tech prototype that was successfully used to secure a
                round of pre-seed funding and early stage users.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are 2 core parts of the product- an indepth, multi stage creating user interface and a dashboard with multilayers of information.
              </p>
              <p>
                This new iteration of the product needed to move Platypus to the next level of development. It should greatly enhance the experience for early stage
                users with an easy to use interface.
              </p>

                <strong>Option to dropdown menus </strong>
                Upon starting the project there were many dropdown menus that were hard to navigate. I knew it would be good with an option, and during research
                came across "Improving the usability of multi-selecting from a long list" on Medium. It even had data showing longer retention by using other options.
                <a href="https://medium.com/tripaneer-techblog/improving-the-usability-of-multi-selecting-from-a-long-list-63e1a67aab35" target="_blank" class="semi-bold" >

              <p><strong>Mobile First Signup / Create User</strong>
                100 % Mobile first layout.
              </p>

              <p><strong> Desktop First Dashboard </strong> <span class="red semi-bold ">Wait, what did I just say?!  </span> I saw Søren Engelbrecht, Senior Mobile Strategist at A.P. Moller - Maersk give a talk, "Mobile When Necessary"
                This shattered MY idea of mobile first ALWAYS.
                Søren's expereince in a large shipping company was that some work needs to be caried out while working on a large screen-- where there are many many levels of information, while other things are done almost entirely on a small device.
              </p>
                <p> With this in mind,
               Research with the Platypus founders who have years of experience working in HR: said they didn't use
                their phones for complicated HR work, as there was too much you needed to see at once, in order for it to make sence.

    The Outcome

       <p class="p-margin-top-none">
       &#10003; A new round of funding of over 1 million kroner.
        </p>
        <p>
        &#10003;
        Coded HTML emails used during the signup process (instead of PDFs)
        Based on investor's feedback about it being difficult to get people to read and complete their emails.
        </p>

        <p>
          &#10003; A signup flow including multiple levels of information that worked on mobile and desktop.

        </p>
        <p>
          &#10003; A product where dropdowns were eleiminated, and buttons were created in stead.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#10003;  Components created with CSS for easy use.

        <div class="headlines-in-banner">My Role</div>
          <p class="">
            There was a team of 5. We had weekly product meetings, where we reviewed what we were working on.
            This was the spring board to define the weeks goals.
          </p>
          <P>
            The functionality desired was the inspiration for visualisation. The way the product would be designed and used was still under construction.
            The founders had a strong idea of what the product should do, but how it would do that was under review constantly.
            Some ideas were taken into production, while others were not.
          </P>
          <P>
            I contributed to showing how we would make their ideas come to life. As a coder, I was always aware of how difficult or easy a feature was to create.
          </P>
          <P>
            Some of the great ideas that were discovered needed to be put on hold because of time demands it would have.
