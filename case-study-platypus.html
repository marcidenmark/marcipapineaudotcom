            <p class="p-margin-top-none">
              Platypus is a Copenhagen based startup working within HR. Its focus is to help companies make good hires, and retain talent.

              The Challenge
            </div>
              <p class="p-margin-top-none">
                Platypus was in an extremely early stage of development. They had a low tech prototype that was successfully used to secure a
                round of pre-seed funding and early stage users.
              </p>
              <p>
                This next iteration should greatly enhance the experience for early stage
                users with an easy to use interface. And continue to get new companies to buy into the product.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are 2 core parts of the product- an in depth user profile completion process, and a dashboard for onboarded companies to utilize
                the information collected from new onboards.

              <p class="">
                There was a team of 5. We had weekly product meetings, where we reviewed what we were working on.
                This was the spring board to define the weeks goals. And decide on what features to work on.
              </p>
              <P>
                The way the product would be designed and used was still under construction.
                The founders had a strong idea of what the product should do, but how it would do that was under review constantly.
                Some ideas were taken into production, while others were not.
              </P>
              <P>
                I contributed to showing how we would make their ideas come to life. As a coder, I was always aware of how difficult or easy a feature was to create.
              </P>
              <P>
                Some of the great ideas that were discovered needed to be put on hold because of time demands it would have.

               <div class="headlines-in-banner">The Process</div>

              <p> <span class="bold">Weekly Product Meetings</span> Once a week we met with the entire team to review what we were woring on, and voice opinions, and review
                what we were working on. We spoke about features in progress, and coming up.
              </p>

              <p> <span class="bold">Dashboard research</span> Tons of reviews of exhisting dashboard layouts for inspiration. Together with the UXer, we looked at many different
                dashboards. Some were for products that were similar to ours, and others that were not, but had good ways to visulaize information.
              </p>

              <p> <span class="bold">UI Research </span> I constantly looked for inspiration for great UI design. One of the places I often go to is
                Steve Schoger's book, "Refactoring UI."
                <a href="https://medium.com/refactoring-ui/7-practical-tips-for-cheating-at-design-40c736799886" target="_blank" class="semi-bold" >
                [ If you're curious, you can see a few of his tips here ]</a>
              </p>

              <p> <span class="bold">Grapic Research </span> There was a JS library already being used. I looked into different options
                for visualizing what we needed.
              </p>
              <p> <span class="bold">Coding Research </span> Looked into the different ways the layout could be coded. One of the things I know from the start was that I
                wanted to code a grid that could easily be used throughout the product. One of the considerations was Flexbox? Grid?
                Grid won.
              </p>
              <p> <span class="bold">Coding</span> Built pages writting HTML & CSS– working closely with the backend developer and UXer.</p>
              <p> <span class="bold">Data Visualization Research</span> Looked into how to show the data so it could be easily understodd. Part of the considerations
              involved different libraries to use.
            </p>
              <p> <span class="bold">Coding Emails </span> I had not done this before. But found it really important to get away from sending information via pdfs in an email.
                Emails can be tricky because they need to be written in an extremely old type of html (using tables). Plux, there is a lot of standard CSS that doesn't work.
              </p>

              <p> <span class="bold">Typography & Colors</span> Were supplied from the UXer.

                <strong>New way to show information instead of dropdown menus </strong>
                Upon starting the project there were many dropdown menus that were hard to navigate. I knew it would be good with an option, and during research
                came across "Improving the usability of multi-selecting from a long list" on Medium. It even had data showing longer retention by using other options.
                <a href="https://medium.com/tripaneer-techblog/improving-the-usability-of-multi-selecting-from-a-long-list-63e1a67aab35" target="_blank" class="semi-bold" >

              </p>

              <p><strong> Desktop First Dashboard </strong> <span class="red semi-bold ">Wait, what did I just say?!  </span> I saw Søren Engelbrecht, Senior Mobile Strategist at A.P. Moller - Maersk give a talk, "Mobile When Necessary"
                This shattered my idea of mobile first ALWAYS.
                Søren's story spoke of Mærsk's large shipping company and their digital needs.
                They of course have work needs to be caried out while working on a multiple large screen because there are multiple levels of
                complicated information. They will never be able to do this on their cell phones on the way home from work. So NO to mobile design.
                But, other things are done almost entirely on a small device while workers are out on the docks. For example checking invetories upon arrival.
                It makes perfect sence of course.
              </p>
                <p> So, With this in mind, and
               research with the Platypus founders who have years of experience working in HR: said they didn't use
                their phones for complicated HR work, as there was too much you needed to see at once, in order for it to make sence.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Mobile First Signup and User Onboarding Interface </strong>
                On the other hand, when users are signing up for the product, they are often NOT at a computer screen. So phones were
                the highest priority.
                The design and code was written for a mobile screen first, and then transfered to desktop, which worked rather seamlessly
                as how it would work there was considered while woring on the mobile screens.
