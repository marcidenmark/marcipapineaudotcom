          Platypus is a Copenhagen based startup working within HR. Its focus is to help companies make good hires, and retain talent.

          The Challenge
        </div>
        <p class="p-margin-top-none">
          Platypus was in an early stage of development. They had a low fidelity proof of concept prototype that was used to successfully secure a
          round of pre-seed funding and early stage users.
        </p>
        <p>
          This next iteration should greatly enhance the experience for early stage
          users with an easy to use interface, and continue to get new companies to buy into the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 2 core parts of the product- an in depth user profile completion process, and a dashboard to visualize and interact with the data collected from users.

          <strong>Finding a replacement to selecting through multiple dropdown menus</strong>
          The early prototype used dropdown menus that were difficult to navigate and use.
          I wanted to replace them. During research I came across a Medium article, “Improving the Usability of Multi-selecting from a Long List.”
          It had data showing that by using alternate ways to visualise selections, one could acomplish
           longer retention times and higher success rates of task completion.

        <p> <span class="bold">Coding Research </span> Looked into different ways to code dashboards. One of the things I knew from the start was that I

        <p><strong> Desktop First Dashboard </strong> <span class="red semi-bold ">Wait, what did I just say?! </span> I saw Søren Engelbrecht, Senior Mobile Strategist at A.P. Moller - Maersk give a talk, "Mobile When Necessary."
          This changed my idea of mobile first ALWAYS.
          Søren's story spoke of Mærsk's large shipping company and their digital needs.
          Some work needs to be caried out while working on a multiple large screens with multiple levels of
          complicated information. They will never be able to do this on their cell phones on the way home from work. So NO to mobile design.
          But, other things are done almost entirely on a small device while workers are out on shipping docks. So mobile first, and maybe even mobile only.
          It makes perfect sence of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research with the Platypus founders, who have years of experience working in HR, said they didn't use
          their phones for complicated hiring work, as there was too much information to see at once– in order for it to make sence of it.
          So, with this in mind,
          we went with a desktop first principle for the complicated information of dashboards.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Mobile First Signup and User Onboarding Interface </strong>
          On the other hand, when users are signing up for the product, they are often NOT at a computer screen. So phones were
          the highest priority.
          The design and code was written for a mobile screen first, and then optimized for desktop.
