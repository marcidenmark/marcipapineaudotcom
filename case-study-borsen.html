          Leading Danish business/financial newspaper in Denmark– read by industry leaders, and used to make
          actionable decisions. Their need was to improve the usability of their information graphics.

          The Challenge
        </div>
        <p class="p-margin-top-none">
          What was needed was to have information graphics that readers could use to help in decision making.
          Børsen's readers are busy. They don't have a lot of time to read the paper, yet it is an important part
          of their day. Information needs to be understood quickly. Børsen has A LOT of information graphics, as they
          often help tell a story of a thousand words in 5-10 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The graphics at the time were difficult to understand. They were represented in units that don't match.
          Units of measure were hard to find. The story was confused.

            <br> Graphic on the left is the older graphic. Graphic on the right is the redesigned one using the following principles. <br>
            <span class="bold">1. </span>Adding a subhead to the headline to pull readers into graphic.
            <span class="bold">2. </span> Placing the unit of measure on the top of the numbers instead of the headline of the graphic.
            <span class="bold">3. </span> Getting rid of the many decimal points for clarity.
            <span class="bold">4. </span> Got rid of the date of the month as the month was enough.
            <span class="bold">5. </span> Added horizontal lines to make the graph easier to read.

            Old graphic on the left. New graphic on the right. <br>
            The older graphic had was eye catching but the story wasn't explained very well. It said there had been some ups and downs–
            ending high. But the fact that the the end of the graphic is an estimate can't easily be seen.
            There was also no easy way to understand the time frame of the graphic. <br>
            <br> The graphic on the left is both quick and easy to understand. Already adding the years on the bottom
            (the sketched in small tics) starts to tell more.
            There is a key on the bottom tells the quantity of one circle.
            and you get the answer to the story in a few seconds. If you are excited by the graphic you would read dive into the story.

          The bubble graphic is a great way to show information because it gives the option of more levels of data than can be in a simple graph. There is the x axis, y axis, colors and size to be uilized.

      <!-- Lollypop Chart  -->
