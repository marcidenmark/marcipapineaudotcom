            <p class="p-margin-top-none">
              Leading Danish business/financial newspaper in Denmark– read by industry leaders, and used to make
              actionable decisions. Their need was to improve the usability of their information graphics.

              The Challenge
            </div>
              <p class="p-margin-top-none">
              Børsen's readers are busy. They don't have a lot of time to read the paper, yet it is an important part
              of their day. Information needs to be understood quickly. Børsen has A LOT of information graphics, as they
              often help tell a story of a thousand words in 5-10 seconds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The graphics at the time were difficult to understand. They were represented in units that don't match.
                Units of measure were hard to find. The story was confused.
              </p>

                revised way to create a good graphic. </p>

             <p> The ultimate goal was to find a way to make sure the graphic was written and designed with information that made sense and was
               easy to understand. </p>


            <div class="headlines-in-banner">The Solution</div>

              Guidelines and processes were setup from the start of a writer requesting a graphic all the way until
              it would be proofread before publication.

              <p><strong> Design </strong>tktktk The client had a really nice logo in the font Didot which would be used, so I needed to
                choose fonts that would pair well with it. The fonts to be used, needed to be free.

               <strong> Typography </strong>
               tktktk The font Georgia is able to be used for free, and it worked well with the pre-existing logo (in the font Didot). It was paired with a simple sans serif, Open Sans.

               <strong> Photography</strong>
              tktktk  Having found the sample image and written a sample text, was able to art direct the photographer, and client so that the headline would be readable
                 on different screen sizes. This included making sure her wardrobe and the background were light-colored so that the headline could be read on all
                screens sizes. (see image)
